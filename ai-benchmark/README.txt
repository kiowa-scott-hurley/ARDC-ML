This folder contains scripts for benchmarking the GPUs on M3 using ai-benchmark (http://ai-benchmark.com/). This tool is designed to test GPUs while performing a variety of AI tasks. 

Each script will run 7 tests per GPU, with the exception of the notes for the P4s. The P4s are used as Strudel Desktop nodes, and the best way to benchmark these is via the desktop. As such, there isn't an sbatch script provided, but a readme with instructions. 

Each script requires some editing which will be clearly commented.
