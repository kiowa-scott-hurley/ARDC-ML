# Instructions to run this example job
This contains an example Python file to test the job monitoring script with. The Python file is taken from the Data Fluency Introduction to Deep Learning and Tensorflow course located here: https://github.com/MonashDataFluency/intro-to-tensorflow. It is a simple Tensorflow script which trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the MNIST dataset. 

This example assumes you have a conda environment with tensorflow-gpu installed, and that the normal commands to run the job would be:

```
source path/to/conda/bin/activate
conda activate CNN_venv

python /path/to/Intro_to_CNNs.py
```

Edit the job monitoring script per the instructions on the other page to reflect these commands. For example, in `job_monitoring_CNN.bash`, you will need to edit:

```
# ###############################################################

cd path/to/job-monitoring/CNN_example
source path/to/conda/bin/activate
conda activate CNN

# ################################################################
```
To reflect your own file paths and Python environment. 

You will also need to edit:
```
# Insert the command you want to monitor here, and add an “&” to the end of it
# ###############################################################

python path/to/job-monitoring/CNN_example/Intro_to_CNNs.py &

# ###############################################################
```

To reflect your own file paths and add the & at the end of the Python command. 

Included in this repo is an example filtered log file generated by running this job monitoring script, `nvidia-filtered.log`, so you can see how the output looks in the Jupyter notebook. 

You'll still need to edit the notebook filepath to this logfile, and update where the plots are saved.
